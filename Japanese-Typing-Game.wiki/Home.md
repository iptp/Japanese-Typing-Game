<h1 align="center">Japanese Typing Game</h1>

Welcome! This project is intended to teach you about the [Greenfoot Environment](http://www.greenfoot.org/overview) workflow while developing a Japanese Typing Game.

This project assumes you know the basics about the [Hiragana Japanese Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana), if you don't, please check the Wikipedia link about it. It's a good opportunity to learn game programming and a new language at the same time :grin:

Also, this project assumes you know the basics around the Greenfoot software. If you don't, please check the ~~previous lessons [here](https://github.com/iptp/greenfoot)~~.

Let's get cracking!

<h2 align="center">Prelude</h2>

In this tutorial, we are going to develop a Japanese typing game. The tutorial is divided into 3 main parts that were
separated thinking about what we need from a typing game and improvements that can be made.

In the [Version 1](https://github.com/iptp/Japanese-Typing-Game/wiki/Version-1) we will develop a typing game where words will fall from the sky while we try to type them before they cross the end line. Our goal is to end up with something like this:

![Goal Image](https://github.com/iptp/Japanese-Typing-Game/blob/master/images/goal.png)

You can see in the image that we have some key features for the first version of the game:
- **The word to be typed**
- **The endline**
- **The word that is being currently typed**

And that's all we need to make a playable typing game. The following versions will be added but not explained as detailed
as the Version 1 since they're meant to be suggestions for you to try on your on. Hints and some explanation will be given.

In [Version 2](https://github.com/iptp/Japanese-Typing-Game/wiki/Version-2) we will try to enhance the user experience
by adding more functionalities to our game:
- **A score counter**
- **Backspace key**
- **Increasing speed of words**
- **More lives**
- **More words**
- **Katakana**

In [Version 3](https://github.com/iptp/Japanese-Typing-Game/wiki/Version-3) we will add new interface functionalities:
- **New graphics**
- **Add music**
- **New game menus**
- **High score**

For the [Extra](https://github.com/iptp/Japanese-Typing-Game/wiki/Extra) part, we suggest:
- **A dictionary of words (words used more appear less frequently)**
- **Get the words from an [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) deck of cards**
